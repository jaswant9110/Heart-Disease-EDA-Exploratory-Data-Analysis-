We are going to divide the project into 6 parts:
     Heart Disease EDA - Age (DistPlot)
     Heart Disease EDA - Categorical Columns (Pie Charts)
     Heart Disease EDA - ViolinPlot
     Heart Disease EDA - Correlation (HeatMap)
     Heart Disease EDA - Corrlation (PairPlot)
     Heart Disease EDA - Correlation - (JointPlot)

By using EDA also known as Exploratory Data Analysis we analysized and visualized Heart Disease dataset.
